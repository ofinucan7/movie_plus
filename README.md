Full stack project based on a stream platform. Some features include:
- Fully responsive front end
- Backend to manage user data
- Encrypted user authentication
- Stripe integration for payments
- Live deployment: movieplus-production.up.railway.app

 Note: This project is hosted on Railway, which may pause inactive sites. If the site takes a few seconds to load initially, thatâ€™s why. :)

Technologies & Skills Learned over Project:
- React - built interactive front end
- TailwindCSS - rapid UI styling and development
- JavaScript - improved my skills / knocked off the rust 
- Docker - containerized both frontend and backend with Dockerfiles
- PostgreSQL / pgAdmin - relational database management and queries
- Cloud deployment - deployed to cloud servers via Railway

While scope creep crept in fast, I am pausing development for now. With more time, I would like to implement auto-email functionality (confirmations of payments, signups, account deletion, etc.), better / safer calls, OAuth, and generally improve the UI more.
