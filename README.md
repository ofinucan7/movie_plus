## MoviePlus – Full-Stack Streaming Platform

Full stack project based on a streaming platform. Some features include:
- Fully responsive front end
- Backend to manage user data
- Encrypted user authentication
- Stripe integration for payments
- Live deployment: [movieplus-production.up.railway.app](https://movieplus-production.up.railway.app)

> **Note:** This project is hosted on Railway, which may pause inactive sites. If the site takes a few seconds to load initially, that’s why. :)

### Technologies & Skills Learned over Project:
- **React** – built interactive front end
- **TailwindCSS** – rapid UI styling and development
- **JavaScript** – improved my skills / knocked off the rust 
- **Docker** – containerized both frontend and backend with Dockerfiles
- **PostgreSQL / pgAdmin** – relational database management and queries
- **Cloud deployment** – deployed to cloud servers via Railway

### Future Improvements (Project Currently Paused)
While scope creep crept in fast, I am pausing development for now. With more time, I would like to implement:
- Auto-email functionality (confirmations of payments, signups, account deletion, etc.)
- Better and safer API/backend calls
- OAuth login
- General UI/UX polish
